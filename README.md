## üìÇ Repository Structure


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
This repository uses Python and requires a virtual environment for dependency management. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the scripts using the virtual environment-specific shebang:
   ```python
   #!python
   ```
